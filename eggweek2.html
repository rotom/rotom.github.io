		Instructor:Tom Roberts<br />
		t.d.h.roberts@uu.nl<br /><br />

		Here you will find all course notes, slides, problems, and a small boatload of optional readings if you are curious to learn more. If there are any errors that need to be corrected I will make a note of that here too.<br /><br />

		If you were not in <a href="https://rotom.github.io/eggweek1">the Week 1 course on sentence types</a>, taking a gander at that page might provide come useful context. However, it possible to understand each course in isolation.
